This document was last updated 7 July 2019.

## Description
Glory is a competitive card game for 2 or more players, using one standard playing card deck (with jokers) for each player. It is played in a series of 4 rounds, in which players win Glory for their kingdom by growing their domain and defeating other players in battle! 

## Requirements
* One standard deck (with jokers) for each player
* Score keeping device for tracking various point values. Poker chips, notepad, spreadsheet, etc.
* A calculator may also be useful

## Objective
To win the game, players must acquire the most Glory Points over a series of 4 rounds. Glory Points are acquired by defeating other players in battle, and increasing the Land in their Domain, be it purchased with Money or won through conquest.

## Cards
Cards have the following values based on rank:

Card   | Value
-------|------
Ace    | 1
2 - 10 | face value
Jack   | 10
Queen  | 11
King   | 12
Joker  | 25

Cards have a particular meaning based on suit/type:

* **Court** (J, Q, K)   
    Court cards are **Generals**. They are required for an attack, and may be deployed during defense. They cannot be used as Land, Money, or Health. The suit of court cards is ignored.
    

* **Clubs**  
    Clubs are **Soldiers**. They may be used during attack or defense.

* **Spades**        
    Spades are **Land**. Land contributes to a player's GP at the end of the round. They also contribute 2 DP each during defense, regardless of their face value.

* **Diamonds**  
	Diamonds are **Money**. Money is used to purchase Land and Mercenaries.

* **Hearts**        
	Hearts are **Health**. Health is used to regain HP.

* **Jokers**        
	Jokers are **Assassins**. They are used to conduct a special attack called Assassination.

## Terminology
These terms and abbreviations will be used throughout the rules:

* **King**  
	Each player is the King of a realm. Each realm consists of a Domain and a Treasury. 

* **Domain**    
	An area in front of each player where Land cards are played face up.

* **Treasury**  
	An area in front of each player where Money cards are played face up.

* **Attack Points** (AP)    
	Used to determine the strength of an attack during an attack action.

* **Defense Points** (DP)   
	Used to determine the strength of a defense during an attack action.
  
* **Hit Points** (HP)   
	Represents the health of a player during a round.

* **Glory Points** (GP)     
	Used to determine the overall winner of the game.


## Setup
### Shuffle
All decks should be shuffled together into one stack. With more than 2 decks, the suggested method for shuffling is for each player to shuffle an equal portion of the cards, then pass half of his cards to  the player sitting next to them and repeat 6 more times. Alternatively, you can do one big wash shuffle with all the cards. After shuffling, combine all the cards into one face-down stack in the center of the table.

### Determine Who Goes First
Each player draws one card off the top of the face down deck. High card goes first. In the case of a tie, the tied players should repeat the draw until there is a clear winner. All drawn cards should be put face up in a discard pile next to the face down deck.

In proceeding rounds, the player with the lowest Glory Point total goes first, and should turn over the top face-down card on the deck to start the discard pile before taking his turn. In the case of a tie, the player on the right goes first. 

### Points
At the beginning of the game, every player starts with 0 Glory Points. They are accumulated throughout the game and are never reset or subtracted from. At the beginning of every round, each player starts with 50 Hit Points. These are reset at the start of each round.

### Deal
Starting with the first player, and proceeding clockwise, each player should draw one face down card, until they have seven cards in their hand. And Money cards drawn should be immediately played face up in the player's Treasury. Keep going around the table drawing cards or passing, until every player has seven non-Money cards in their hand.

## Play
Play proceeds clockwise from the first player.

### Money Cards
Any time during the game when a player draws a Money card, it should be immediately played face up into his Treasury, and a replacement card should be drawn. Repeat this until a non-Money card is drawn.

### Showing Cards
At no point during the game, may players reveal the cards in their hand to another player, before putting them into play. 
 
### Actions
On each turn, players must play one (and only one) of the following actions: Buy Land, Conquer Land, Attack a King, Assassination, Heal, or Discard. Players must declare their action and target (if applicable), unless they are discarding.

#### Buy Land
* Players may discard any number of Money cards from their Treasury to play any number of Land cards from their hand.
* The combined value of Money cards discarded must be equal to or greater than the combined value of all Land cards played. 
* No change or refund is given if the Money discarded exceeds the total value of the Land played.
* Players must place Land cards face up on the table in their Domain so that other players can see their value clearly.
* After Land cards have been played, players must draw back up to seven cards in their hand.

#### Attacking
There are two types of attack that a player may attempt: Conquering Land, and Attacking a King. Both types of attack must adhere to the following rules:

* **Attacking Player**
	* Attackers must play at least one General from their hand to attack an opponent.
	* They may add any number of Generals and Soldiers from their hand to increase their Attack Points.
	* Players may also add Mercenaries to their attack by spending Money from their Treasury. Each Money card added to the attack raises the AP by 1/2 the face value of the card, rounded up.
	* The Attacker must present his entire force on declaration of the attack, including Money cards used to buy Mercenaries.
	* Example: King + Jack + 10 clubs + 4 clubs + 9 diamonds = 12 + 10 + 10 + 4 + 5 = 41 AP
* **Defending Player**
	* The player being attacked may play any Generals and Soldiers from his hand to increase his Defense Points.
	* The defender is *NOT* required to play a General.
	* All Lands the defender has in his Domain add 2 DP, regardless of their face value.
	* Defenders may not hire Mercenaries.
	* Example: Queen + 8 clubs + 3 clubs + 2 Land cards in Domain = 11 + 8 + 3 + 4 = 26 DP

#### Conquering Land
A player may attack another player's Domain in order to take his Land! If the attacker is successful, he gains control of the lowest-ranked Land card in the defender's Domain. Assistance from other players is not allowed when attacking or defending a Domain.

* **Resolution**
	* The total AP of the attack is the sum value of all Generals, Soldiers, and Mercenaries played by the attacker.
	* The total DP of the defense is the sum value of all Generals and Soldiers played by the defender, plus 2 DP for each Land card the defender has in his Domain.
	* If the total AP for the attack is greater than the total DP, the attacking player takes the lowest valued Land card from the defender's Domain and moves it to his.
	* If the total AP is equal to or lesser than the total DP, the attack fails and no Land is taken.
	* All Generals, Soldiers, and Mercenaries involved in the attack and defense are discarded after the attack is resolved.
	* The defender should draw back up to seven cards in his hand.
	* If the attack was successful, the attacker should also draw back up to seven cards.
	* If the attack failed, the attacker must wait until the start of his next turn to draw back up to seven cards, unless he is attacked in the interim, in which case he may draw back up to seven, after the attack is resolved.
* **Score**
	* If the attack was successful (AP > DP)
		* The attacking player gets +2 Glory Points
	* If the attack failed (AP <= DP)
		* The defending player gets +2 Glory Points
		
#### Attacking a King
A player may attack another player directly to reduce his HP and gain Glory! If the attack is successful, the defender loses HP. If the defender's HP is reduced to zero, the player is eliminated and the round is over. Other players not initially involved in the attack may be called in to assist either side.

* **Assisting**
	* Appeals for assistance from either side may be made after the attack has been declared.
	* Players who are not the attacker or defender may assist either side with Generals and Soldiers from their hand, adding it to the total AP or DP, depending on which side they are assisting.
	* Assisting players may not hire Mercenaries.
	* As an incentive to assist them, the attacker and defender may offer other players Lands from their Domain or Money from their Treasury in exchange for help. Land cards still in the hand may not be offered.
	* All Land and Money transfers should be executed after the attack is resolved.
	* If Land is accepted from the defender, it still adds 2 DP per card for this attack.
* **Resolution**
	* The total AP of the attack is the sum value of all Generals, Soldiers, and Mercenaries played by the attacker and those assisting him.
	* The total DP of the defense is the sum value of all Generals and Soldiers played by the defender and those assisting him, plus 2 DP for each Land card the defender has in his Domain.
	* If the total AP for the attack is greater than the total DP, the defending player deducts the difference from his HP.
	* If the total AP is equal to or lesser than the total DP, the attack fails and no HP are deducted.
	* All Generals, Soldiers, and Mercenaries involved in the attack and defense are discarded after the attack is resolved.
	* Any Land or Money exchanged for assistance should be transferred to the Domain or Treasury of the recipient.
	* All players who are not the attacker should draw back up to seven cards in their hand.
	* If the attack was successful, the attacker should also draw back up to seven cards.
	* If the attack failed, the attacker must wait until the start of his next turn to draw back up to seven cards, unless he is attacked in the interim, in which case he may draw back up to seven, after the attack is resolved.
* **Score**
	* If the attack was successful (AP > DP)
		* The attacking player gets +5 Glory Points
		* Players assisting the attacker get +2 Glory Points
		* If the defender was eliminated (HP <= 0), all points awarded are doubled
	* If the attack failed (AP <= DP)
		* The defending player gets +5 Glory Points
		* Players assisting the defender get +2 Glory Points

#### Assassination
Assassination is a special attack that does a large amount of damage to a player's HP. Assassins cannot participate in regular attacks or be combined with Generals, Soldiers, or Mercenaries. Nor can other players assist in any way.  

* **Rounds**
	* Assassination involves one or more "mini-rounds" between the attacker and defender
	* First the attacker presents 1 or more Assassins from his hand
	* The defender must then present an equal number of Assassins, otherwise the assassination succeeds
	* If the assassination failed, the attacker may present another round of 1 or more Assassins, provided he has them in his hand
	* Rounds may continue as long as the attacker has Assassins
	* The defender is not required to thwart the assassination attempt, if he is able to
* **Resolution**
	* If the final round was a success (defender did not match Assassin cards), 25 points are deducted from the defender's HP.
	* All Assassins played by both sides must be discarded.
	* The defender should draw back up to seven cards in his hand.
	* The attacker may also draw back up to seven cards if the assassination succeeded, otherwise he must wait until the start of his next turn.
* **Score**
	* If the assassination succeeded
		* The attacking player gets +2 Glory Points
		* If the defender was eliminated (HP <= 0), he gets an additional +2 Glory Points
	* If the assassination failed
		* The defending player gets +2 Glory Points

#### Heal
* A player may discard a single Health card to regain 1/2 its value, rounded up in HP. Only one Health card may be played per turn.
* A player may never have more than 50 HP. Any excess HP gained from healing is lost. 
* After healing, players must draw a card to bring their hand back up to seven cards.

#### Discard
* If a player cannot or does not wish to perform any other action, he must discard any one card from his hand. 
* If a player discards an Ace, he may discard any number of other cards along with it as long as he shows the Ace to the other players.
* After discarding, a player must draw back up to seven cards.

## End of the Round
The round can end in one of two ways:

1. If a player draws the last card from the deck, the round ends after that player's turn.
2. If a player is reduced to 0 HP, the round ends immediately.

### Scoring
* Each player sums the value of the Land cards in their Domain and adds it to their Glory Point total.
* Unless the player was eliminated (HP <= 0), in which case he does not get any points for the Land in his Domain. He does however, retain Glory Points won during the round.

Unless it is the last round, all cards are returned to the deck and reshuffled. All players reset their HP to 50. The next round begins with the player who has the lowest GP total for the game. In the case of a tie, the player on the right goes first.

## End of the Game
The standard game length is 4 rounds, though players may choose to play more or less rounds for a longer or shorter game.

The player with the most Glory Points at the end of the last round is victorious! If two or more players are tied for the most GP, additional rounds must be played until a winner can be declared.
